**IP Locator** is a WordPress plugin which generates specific rewrite rules for [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) Apache modules.

When you want to use [server-info](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/en/mod/mod_info.html) and/or [server-status](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_status.html) with Apache server, you must modify (right in your `.htaccess` file) the rewrite rules generated by WordPress. And you must do it each time WordPress modify and regenerates the rules.
**IP Locator** do it for you, without you having to intervene. Just activate it and that's it!

See [WordPress directory page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip-locator/).
